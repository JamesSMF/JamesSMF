## Main Focus
+ Deep Learning Algorithms
+ Image Semantic Segmantation
+ Few-shot Learning (classification and segmentation)
+ Medical Image segmentation
+ Application of Transformers in Computer Vision

## Current Work
Stacked Dense Inception U-Net for liver tumor segmentation
+ liver: 95.09% Dice global
+ Tumor: 75.1% Dice global

Next, I plan to combine segmentation with classification. The model will not only segment the tumor, but also name the type of the tumor. Yes, I need a doctor (to teach me some medical knowledge about liver lesion). Tired of teaching myself :(

Currently, our lab is colaborating with a hospital. However, well-labeled data are really hard to get. I am currently working on few-shot learning. (Sadly, Prototype Net based models do not work well on this task)

## Philosophy
Most people in this world are simply doing meta learning through their whole life.
