## Current Work
Recently I am interested in FSL via embedding learning. Therefore I am teaching myself some knowledge about topology and manifold.

Also, this work seems dope: Learning Dynamic Alignment via Meta-filter for Few-shot Learning. I am trying to learn neural ordinary differential equations as well.


## Philosophy
Most people in this world are simply doing meta learning through their whole life.
